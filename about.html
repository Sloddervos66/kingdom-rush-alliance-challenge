        <p>Welcome to the kingdom rush alliance challenge maker website!<br>
        None of this website is official by Ironhide. This website is made by a fan for other fans.</p>
        
        This website is meant for people who are bored of using the same strategy for every single map. You may pick to include the map, towers and heroes.<br>
        However, you may also decide to only include towers, heroes or map.

        <p>Do note this website is made entirely by one person and therefore I have to figure stuff out all by myself as well.<br>
        I have great plans for this website, but it is still WIP (Work In Progress).</p>

        As of now I will be adding the maps, towers, heroes and some simple customisation settings.<br>
        However in the future I'd love to have detailed information about all the maps and maybe even an encyclopedia.

        <p>So stay tuned and see where does site leads to!</p>
    
        All of the code made for this website is open source, you can find it in the following link: <a href="https://github.com/Sloddervos66/kingdom-rush-alliance-challenge">Link to github page</a>

        <p>Stay sharp commander and keep on rushing!</p>

        For the alliance!
